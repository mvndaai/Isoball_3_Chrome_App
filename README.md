This is my first attempt at an Chrome App (http://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html). Here is what I did, and what who actually made the content so I don't get in trouble. This was probably the worst way to start, embedding a flash game, but the game was the only thing I had on chrome already.

I took a game that already had an "app" (read website redirect) made by evolvedarcade: http://www.evolvedonlinegames.com/app.php?id=6216
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/isoball-3/iajlkcpgcnbhfhpdeooockfaincfkjjj?utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher

I found the swf file they use: http://www.chromeplay.com/games/game6216.swf
I had to save the swf because it said I didn't have flash play installed otherwise.

Thank you Gimme5games for making it flashy I guess: http://www.gimme5games.com/play-game/isoball-3
The iOS version supposedly was made by this guy: http://www.zattikka.com/
Download it here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/isoball/id404000220

I didn't mean to steal anyone's money from ads or however they make money.

There is still an ad at the biginning, but the app cannot open with external links.
